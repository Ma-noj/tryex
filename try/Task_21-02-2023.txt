You are given a string str of size n.

You can perform the following operation on it:

In one operation, you have to choose any character in the string s, 
then delete the first character to the left of the chosen character 
that is equal to the chosen character (if there exists) and delete the 
first character to the right of the chosen character that is equal to 
the chosen character (if there exists). 

Note that 
in one operation, the length of the string s is reduced by a maximum 
of two characters.
Task

You want to minimize the length of the string str.

Find the minimum number of operations that need to be performed to 
minimize the length of the string str.
