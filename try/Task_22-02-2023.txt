Given an array of N integers

You have to transform the array,for every i(1<=i<=N):a[i]=a[i]%2 

For example: if the given array is 3,4,5 then after the 
transformation the array will be 1,0,1

Your task is to convert the array into a palindrome and 
for that you can re-arrange the elements however you wish

Is it possible to convert the array into a palindrome?

print 1 if the array can be converted into a palindrome or else print 0
